Toronto based investors have signed a $1 Billion deal to aquire MDA. The company behind the creation of the Canadarm.

The group says MDA's corporate headquarters will return to Canada, where it employs more than 1,900 people. MDA's headquarters and largest operations had been in the Vancouver area until Maxar Technologies was created to allow MDA's acquisition of Colorado-based DigitalGlobe, a producer of high-resolution Earth-imagery products. The acquisition of MDA will be financed through a combination of equity and debt.
