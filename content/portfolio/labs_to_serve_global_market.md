MediPharm Labs Corp. (LABS.TO) (MEDIF) (MLZ.F) ("MediPharm Labs" or the "Company"), today announced that the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (the "TGA") has notified the Company that its Canadian manufacturing facility meets the requirements for Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products ("GMP"), a key business breakthrough that increases MediPharm Labs’ global manufacturing capabilities.

The TGA is the branch of the of the Australian Government’s Department of Health responsible for regulating therapeutic goods including prescription medicines, vaccines and medical devices, and is one of 52 regulatory authority members of the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S), an international co-operative that harmonizes GMP standards and quality systems of inspectorates in the field of medicinal products.

During an intensive audit under the TGA’s clearance program for the overseas manufacture of medicine and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients ("APIs") for supply to Australia, MediPharm Labs demonstrated that its state-of-the-art Canadian facility met the PIC/S GMP requirements as a Medicines Manufacturer.

While the certificate was issued by Australia’s TGA to permit MediPharm Labs’ Canadian facility to deliver APIs and final medicinal products to the Australian medical cannabis market, upon MediPharm Labs’ Australian production facility receiving its GMP certificate, the Company will be positioned to leverage a global supply chain to sell cannabis APIs across multiple regions globally.

"GMP certification is the ticket to gaining access to the rapidly growing global medical cannabis market. And it is the recognized standard by which pharmaceutical manufacturers and consumer packaged goods companies worldwide judge their supply partners." said Pat McCutcheon, CEO of MediPharm Labs.

MediPharm Labs is the first Canadian extraction-only cannabis company to announce TGA GMP certification, reflecting that the Company’s Canadian facility was purpose-built to GMP standards. This internationally recognized certification is only granted to companies that can demonstrate consistency, precision and quality in all stages of production.
