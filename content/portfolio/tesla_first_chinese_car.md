Tesla Inc. delivered its first China-built cars on Monday, a milestone for Elon Musk’s company as it accelerates a push in the world’s largest electric-vehicle market. A total of 15 vehicles were to be handed over. Chief Executive Officer Musk is counting on the China plant to help build on recent momentum for the company in the world’s largest market both for EVs and autos in general. The Model 3 will compete with electric cars from local contenders such as NIO Inc. and Xpeng Motors, as well as global manufacturers including BMW AG and Daimler AG.

While China-built cars aren’t yet being delivered to customers outside the company, Monday’s milestone caps several months of wins for Musk. The stock has surged since the carmaker reported a surprise profit on Oct. The shares closed little changed at US$430.38 on Friday.
